# Clustering methods in *R*
Assignment realized for the course *Multivariate Analysis* at *Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya*. 
 
 Implementation and comparison of Clustering methods in *R*, on top of a dataset containing data about 50 patients with different stages of *prostate cancer*. The `clustering.Rmd` *R* markdown file contains the detailed procedure of the performed analysis:
 
 - As a first step we perform a preliminary *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* on the provided dataset `prostate.RData`
 - After having prepared the data, we apply  and compare several Clustering methods: Hierarchical, Partitioning and Model-based clustering.

The project is entirely realized using the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language.

 - `clustering.html` and `clustering.pdf` contain, respectively, the *.html* and *.pdf* version of the R notebook `clustering.Rmd`
